# Overlap-Add Method Using MATLAB

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the **Overlap-Add (OLA) method**, a **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) technique** used for efficiently filtering **long signals** with a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter**. By segmenting the input, processing smaller parts individually, and recombining the results, OLA reduces **computational complexity** compared to direct convolution.  

## 🎯 Objective  
To implement and demonstrate the **Overlap-Add method** in MATLAB for **efficient signal filtering** while minimizing computational load.  

## 🛠 Methodology  
1️⃣ **Segmenting the Input Signal** – The signal is divided into **non-overlapping blocks**.  
2️⃣ **Zero-Padding** – Each segment is **zero-padded** to prevent **circular convolution**.  
3️⃣ **Convolution of Segments** – Each segment is **linearly convolved** with the FIR filter.  
4️⃣ **Overlap and Add** – The convolved segments are **overlapped and summed** to reconstruct the **output signal**.  

## 🔢 MATLAB Implementation  
The repository includes a **MATLAB script** that:  
✅ Takes user input for **input sequence, filter, and segment length**.  
✅ Performs **segmentation, zero-padding, and convolution**.  
✅ Implements the **Overlap-Add method** to reconstruct the **filtered signal**.  
✅ **Plots the input signals, filter, and final output**.  

## 📊 Sample Input & Output  

### **Input:**
